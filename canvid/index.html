        <h2>still being lame.</h2>
        <p>The short and sweet is that I hide a video player on the page then copy the image data from each frame,
            drawing it onto the canvas in the next position.
            <br>I think there is a real future in hiding video tag presentation and then incorporating that data into
            canvas.
            <br>Animation identical to <a href="../canvas">Motion w/ Image</a> just with a video instead of an image,
            watermark code from <a href="../watermark">here</a></p>
        <p>I promise to be less lame with these experiments soon</p>
        <p>This did expose a strange bug in Firefox. Placing semi-transparent text on a canvas with a similar or no
            background-color results in the text with a strange green/blue/yellow artifact outlining the letters. In the
            end I did work around it, but got tired of mucking around and decided to just leave it as an example of a
            bug. So in Firefox you&apos;re seeing the issue, not so in Chrome or Safari.</p>
