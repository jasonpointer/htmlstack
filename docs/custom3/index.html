<p><span class="dropCase">G</span>etting pretty happy with this.  Video & volume scrubbers are both canvas.  The code is similar enough for both that I shuold be able to write a generic scrubber handler piece from this.
I made them both taller so that the highlighting the adjacent elements is less likely.  This also allowed me to trim back on the CSS needed to position everything. </p>

<p> The player/controller also adapts to the size of the video element automatically.  Mostly it's just the video scrubber that has to be adjusted to 40% of the player area +8 pixels, or (player.videoWidth*.4)+8.  The plus 8 is meant to be a buffer to deal with the fact that right now you have to scroll out of the scrubber to hit 100% duration or volume, but I have not wrapped that up yet.</p>

<p>Pretty happy to have taken this so far w/o any real dependencies, no jQuery, prototype, etc.  Firefox is proving to be a cunt of a browser right now, but will get her tamed a bit next time around.  The code for fullscreen was just kinda thrown together at the last minute, but will address that as well.</p>
